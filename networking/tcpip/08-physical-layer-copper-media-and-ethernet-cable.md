Each device must have a port to insert the cable into, and that port is connected to a specific circuit that allow the device to communicate using that cable. That circuit is called **NIC (Network Interface Card - Card mạng)**, and its price vary based on the cable it has to control (copper-based, fiber-optic, wireless antenna and so on):
- Copper-based: analog signals are electrical signals (electromagnetic signals).
- Fiber-optic: analog signals are light.
- WIFI: analog signals are radio frequencies (electromagnetic signals).

**Bandwidth** defines how many bits can be sent over a communication media (cable, wireless) in a second, therefore it is measured in *bits per second (bps)* and multiples.

Now, the Ethernet cable is the one used in **LAN (Local Area Network)** deployments, in other words is the one used to connect all users’ PCs together and to the devices that bridge them to the Internet.
