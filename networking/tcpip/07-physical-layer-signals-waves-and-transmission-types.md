Computers are digital (0/1), real world is analog (there's something in between: 0.1, 0.2).

A digital signal is discret and an analog signal is continuous. In order to represent an analog signal, we measure it at specific time intervals in order to have an approximate digital version, this process is called **spampling**. That's what computers do when it receives a (analog) signal.

To send information, computers need to convert digital signals to analog signals:
  - An electronic circuit generates a (continuous) **carrier wave** that goes up and down always at the same interval, repeatedly and constanly (perfect). Then we modify that wave to send information (điều chế tín hiệu).

The **clock**, in a computer, is the circuit that tells the computer to do its calculations and measurements periodically.
