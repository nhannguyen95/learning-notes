Base 10 (Each unit, in fact, is exactly 1,024 times the previous one. However, it is an accepted practice to floor to 1000.)

|Unit|bytes|bits|

Computers also communicate using binary numbers. When a computer sends binary numbers in a wire, these numbers are sent in a row, one next to the other. On the other end of the cable, the other computer processes 1 single bit in a single instant.

*Therefore, while storage and processing units are multiples of bytes (because we have the opportunity to work in a parallel manner), for data transfer units are multiples of bits: **Kilobit (Kb)**, **Megabit (Mb)**, **Gigabit (Gb)**; each 1024 times the previous one (**b is the symbol for bit**, **B is the symbol for byte**).*

**Bitwise operations**: and, or, xor (exclusive or), not.
