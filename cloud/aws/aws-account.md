# AWS Account

## A container for identities (users) and AWS Resources.

## When creating an AWS, you provide a unique email address and a credit card.

## Root user
- Created when you initially signed up for your AWS account.
- It has full control over the AWS account.
- It can't be restricted nor deleted.
- It is the only user that can completely delete your AWS account
- It's important to keep the root user secured, and not to use it for day-to-day tasks.
- It is identified by the email you provided when you created your AWS account.
- You can sign in your AWS account using the root user credential with its email and password combo.
