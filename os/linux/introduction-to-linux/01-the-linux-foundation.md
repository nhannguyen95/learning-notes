## Course Linux Requirements

Three major Linux distribution families that currently exist:
- Red Hat Family Systems
- SUSE Family Systems
- Debian Family Systems

### The Red Hat Family

```
[Linux Kernel]
      |
     RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
      |
    Fedora
     /  \
    /    \
CentOS  Oracle Linux
```

Fedora distribution family:
- Often serves as an upstream testing platform for RHEL.
- Uses the RPM-based yum package manager to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
- RHEL is widely used by enterprises which host their own systems.

### The SUSE Family

```
[Linux Kernel]
      |
     SUSE
      |
     SLES
      |
   openSUSE
```

SUSE family:
- Uses the RPM-based zypper package manager to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
- SLES is widely used in retail and many other sectors.

### The Debian Family

```
[Linux Kernel]
      |
    Debian
      |
    Ubuntu
      |
  Linux Mint
```

- Debian is a pure open source community project (not owned by any corporation) and has a strong focus on stability.
- Debian provides by far the largest and most complete software repository to its users of any Linux distribution.
- Debian family uses the DPKG-based APT package manager (using apt-get, apt-cache, etc.) to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
- Ubuntu distro is commonly used on both servers and desktop computers.
