Goal/problems: technique:
- Ability to store big data: consistent hashing to spread the load across servers.
- Highly availability reads: [[replication]], multi-data center setup.
- Highly availability writes: versioning and conflict resolution with vector clocks.
- Dataset partition: consistent hashing.
- Incremental scalability: consistent hashing.
- Heterogeneity: consistent hashing.
- Tunable consistency: quorum consensus.
- Handling temporary failures: sloppy quorum and hinted handoff.
- Handling permanent failures: Merkle tree.
- Handling data center outage: cross-data center replication.
