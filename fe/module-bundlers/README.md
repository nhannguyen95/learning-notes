A module bundler takes all of the Javascript code in your project, along with any other assets like images or stylesheets, and creates a bundle that can be loaded by the browser. It also allows you to use a variety of loaders and plugins to transform and optimize your code and assets.

Some popular module bundlers: Webpack (written in Javascript), esbuild (Go), Vite, etc. Module bundler and Javascript compiler are often used together in modern web development.
