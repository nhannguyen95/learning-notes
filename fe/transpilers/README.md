A JavaScript compiler/transpiler allows you to use new JavaScript language features that are not yet supported by some browsers. It allows you to write code that uses these newer features, and then it converts the code into a version that is compatible with most modern browsers. This makes it easier to use newer JavaScript language features, without having to worry about compatibility issues.

Some popular Javascript compilers/transpiler: Babel.
