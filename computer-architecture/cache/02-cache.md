Cache was the name chosen to represent the level of the memory hierarchy between the processor and main memory in the first commercial computer to have this extra level.

The term is also used to refer to any storage managed to take advantage of locality of access.

- Fully associative cache (2)
- Set-associative cache = (1) + (2)
