This is my note while learning about cache in the book [Computer Organization and Design MIPS Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-MIPS-Architecture/dp/0124077269/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1536553502&sr=1-1&keywords=Computer+Organization+and+Design+MIPS+Edition).

There are several concepts that are not clearly explained in the book, like *cache block size* and *byte addressing*. Luckily I found [this lecture](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse378/) [notes](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse378/11wi/lectures.html) which also refers to the book, it has the cache covered.
